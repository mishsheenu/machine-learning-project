CREDIT RISK AND LOAN DEFAULT
The project involves building predictive models to assess credit risk and predict loan defaults. After loading and exploring the loan dataset, various preprocessing steps were applied, including handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables. Feature engineering techniques were employed to prepare the data for model training. Two classifiers, Logistic Regression and XGBoost, were trained using GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters and improve performance. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Both models demonstrated robust performance, with XGBoost outperforming Logistic Regression. The project aims to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions by automating the loan approval process and minimizing financial risks.
